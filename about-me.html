<h2>Information about the designer</h2>
<p>Even though I'm currently a college player for bushnell university, my soccer journey has started way before this. The love for the soccer ball started since i was 2 years old and could first have contact with it. From playing on the futsal court of my neighborhood to watching soccer games all day with my dad, soccer was the only thing i had a passion about. In my journey to this point, I had the privalege of playing in various clubs against many strong opponents. Having played in clubs like Sao Paulo, Palmeiras, Santos, Florida Elite and Dumiense, I was able with my companions to win the Sao Paulo state championship and three Ecnl Southeast conference titles. Hope that this new chapter of my life in a new team comes with many friendships and happy experiences for my life. </p>
